# Sarcasm-Detector

## Hi ðŸ˜ƒ 

### In this Repository I have made a Bidirectional LSTM Model which helps to predict that a given headline is Sarcastic or not.

Electronic journalism powered with Social media has become one of the major sources of information consumption lately. Many media houses are using creative ways in order to tap into increasing views on posts. One of the ways is using sarcastic headlines as click baits. A model that is able to predict whether a piece of headline is sarcastic or not can be useful for media houses in order to analyse their quarterly earnings by strategy. Also, from a reader's perspective, search engines can utilise this information of sarcasm and depending on the readerâ€™s preference, recommend similar articles to them.

After the Model Making I have used the Flask web Framework to deploy the model on Heroku Cloud Plateform.
